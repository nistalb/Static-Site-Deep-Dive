# Static-Site-Deep-Dive
This is a very simple and lightly styled static website that has been built using flexbox and validated for best practices using W3C Markup Validation and performance tested using Google PageSpeed Insights.  The goal of this project is to practice flexbox in making a responsive website and to learn about W3C Markup Valication and Google PageSpeed Insights.

Responsively will be used to improve the responsiveness of the site after initial creation.
