# Static-Site-Optimization
This is a very simple and lightly styled static website that has been built using flexbox and validated for best practices using W3C Markup Validation and performance tested using Google PageSpeed Insights.  The goal of this project is to practice flexbox in making a responsive website and to learn about W3C Markup Validation and Google PageSpeed Insights.

Responsively will be used to improve the responsiveness of the site after initial creation.

# W3C Validation
https://validator.w3.org/

On the first pass through the validator this message was returned:
"Article lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all articles."

I was using an article tag for each image conatining card.  I changed the article tag to a div tag to avoid this message.
